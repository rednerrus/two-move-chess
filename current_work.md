# Current Work: Chess App Styling Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-06-19  
**Objective:** Implement modern, professional styling for the Two-Move Chess application

## Context
We have a fully functional Two-Move Chess game deployed to GitHub Pages. The game logic is complete and working correctly. Now we're enhancing the visual design to make it more professional and user-friendly.

## Zen's Consultation Results

### Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Theming Approach
- **Piece Themes:** Use JavaScript config (`pieceTheme`) for piece assets
- **UI Theming:** Use CSS Custom Properties for colors and responsive design
- **Theme Switching:** JavaScript toggle for instant light/dark mode switching

### Key Insights from Research:
1. **jbkunst/chessboardjs-themes** provides multiple professional piece sets
2. **Lichess.org** uses CSS-only styling changes for themes
3. **Responsive design** can be achieved with viewport-based sizing
4. **Hybrid approach** is most maintainable for static sites
