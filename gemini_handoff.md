# Two-Move Chess Troubleshooting Handoff to Gemini (Updated)

## Current Issue (UPDATED)
**Issue Evolution:**
1. ✅ **FIXED:** Status display now correctly shows which player should move during double moves
2. ✅ **FIXED:** `onDragStart` now correctly allows dragging pieces for the right player during double moves
3. ❌ **CURRENT PROBLEM:** During a double move, Black can pick up and drag pieces, but the move gets rejected and pieces snap back

## Detailed Problem Description
**Test Sequence:** Normal moves → White captures Black piece → Black gets double move
- Black can drag pieces (onDragStart allows it) ✅
- Move gets rejected by chess.js and piece snaps back ❌
- Issue is specifically with **pawn double moves** (e.g., f7-f5)

## Recent Fix Attempts
**Date:** 2025-06-19

### Fix 1: onDragStart Logic (✅ SUCCESSFUL)
Updated `onDragStart()` to prioritize `currentDoubleMoveTurn` over `game.turn()` during double moves.

### Fix 2: FEN Manipulation (❌ FAILED)
Attempted to manipulate FEN string to switch turns, but chess.js rejects or reverts invalid positions.

### Fix 3: Temporary Game Validation (❌ CURRENT ATTEMPT)
Current approach uses temporary Chess() instance for validation, then applies move to real game.

## Current Code State
The code now has extensive debugging logs showing the exact state at each step. Key findings:

**Working Parts:**
- `onDragStart`: Correctly allows Black pieces to be dragged during double move
- `handleTurnEndLogic`: Correctly identifies when player should continue with 2nd move
- Status display: Shows correct "Black to move (2 of 2 moves)"

**Failing Part:**
- `onDrop`: Move validation fails because `game.turn()` is 'w' but trying to move Black pieces

## Debug Log Analysis
```
// Black's first move of double move - WORKS
onDrop: game.turn(): b, currentDoubleMoveTurn: b ✅

// Black's second move attempt - FAILS  
onDrop: game.turn(): w, currentDoubleMoveTurn: b ❌
// Creates temporary game with correct turn, but move still fails
```

## Core Technical Problem
`chess.js` library's `game.move()` function validates moves against its internal turn state. During double moves:
- Our custom logic correctly tracks who should move (`currentDoubleMoveTurn: 'b'`)
- But chess.js thinks it's White's turn (`game.turn(): 'w'`)
- This mismatch causes all Black moves to be rejected as illegal

## Approaches Tried
1. **FEN Manipulation:** Modify FEN string to change active player - chess.js rejects/reverts
2. **Temporary Game:** Validate on temp game, apply to real game - still fails
3. **Turn Switching:** Temporarily switch turn, make move, switch back - inconsistent state

## Files Modified
- `script.js` - Lines 25-102 contain all the debugging and fix attempts
- Extensive console.log statements throughout for debugging

## Testing Setup
- **Local Server:** http://localhost:3000 via `npx http-server -p 3000`
- **Repository:** https://github.com/rednerrus/two-move-chess
- **Browser Console:** Shows detailed logs of every move attempt

## Specific Question for Gemini
How can we allow Black to make their second move when chess.js thinks it's White's turn? We need to either:
1. Successfully override chess.js turn validation temporarily, OR
2. Find an alternative approach that doesn't fight with chess.js's internal state

The double-move logic itself is sound - the issue is purely the conflict between our custom turn management and chess.js's built-in turn system.
